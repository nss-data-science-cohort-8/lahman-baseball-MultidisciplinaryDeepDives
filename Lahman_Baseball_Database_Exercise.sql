-- 1. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each player's first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

	vp.namelast AS "Last Name",
	COALESCE(SUM(s.salary), 0) AS "Total Salary"

--Ans: David Price, $81,851,296


 
--What NOT to do: the following query contains a 1-to-many join with collegeplaying which will then count the affected players' salaries multiple times (via SUM() ).

--2. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

--3. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends? (Hint: For this question, you might find it helpful to look at the generate_series function (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-srf.html).

--4. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases. Report the players' names, number of stolen bases, number of attempts, and stolen base percentage.


--best, most accurate, and most robust solution:
SELECT namegiven, namefirst, namelast, SUM(sb) AS Total_Stolen_Bases, SUM(cs) AS Total_Caught_Stealing, SUM(sb) + SUM(cs) AS Total_Attempts, SUM(sb)*100.0 / (SUM(sb) + SUM(cs)) AS stealing_pct

--5a. From 1970 to 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series?
--5b. What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion; determine why this is the case. Then redo your query, excluding the problem year.  


--Initial exploratory steps:

SELECT teamID, WSWin, SUM(W) AS Total_Wins
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid >= 1970 AND yearid <= 2016 AND WSWin = 'N'
GROUP BY teamID, WSWin
ORDER BY Total_Wins DESC
;

SELECT teamID, WSWin, W AS Yearly_Wins
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid >= 1970 AND yearid <= 2016 AND WSWin = 'Y'
ORDER BY Yearly_Wins
;



--EDA: 1994 is the problem year in which the WSWin column has NULLs. 1981 has a shortened season, due to strike. 

SELECT *
FROM teams 
WHERE yearid >= 1970 AND yearid <= 2016 AND (WSWin IS NULL OR W IS NULL)
ORDER BY w DESC
;


--Excluding year 1994:

SELECT teamID, yearID, WSWin, W AS Yearly_Wins
FROM teams AS t
WHERE yearid >= 1970 AND yearid <= 2016 AND WSWin = 'Y' AND yearid != 1994
ORDER BY Yearly_Wins
;
--Ans: 63

-- If we are to only assess the result from a yearly binary perspective, then we see

-- Ans 2: Since year 1994 doesn't have WS data and year 1981 was shortened by strike, 12/45 = 26.6667% is the answer when we exclude both 1994 and 1981. 

-- If we're to assess the results from a teams' perspective , we see 12 out of 52 teams with most yearly wins also won the World Series in the same year = 23.077% if we only exclude year 1994.

--Open-ended Qs:
--11. Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.




--12. In this question, you will explore the connection between number of wins and attendance.
--12a. Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins?



--12b. Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about teams that made the playoffs? Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a wild card winner.



--13. It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective. Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers are compared with right-handed pitchers. Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? Are they more likely to make it into the hall of fame?
